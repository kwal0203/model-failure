## What failed

The default publishing loop for security notes is usually too slow.

## Why it failed

Notes are scattered and lack a consistent schema.

## Minimal repro

Try finding one audit and one post with the same metadata fields.

## Fix / mitigation

Use Astro content collections with strict frontmatter validation.

## Notes

This is a starter entry.
