## Problem

The paper studies attack-aware guardrail design.

## Key idea

Separate policy interpretation from execution time controls.

## Method

Evaluate attack suites against layered filtering.

## Results

Improved block rates with minor utility impact.

## Failure modes / limitations

May overfit known attack styles.

## Security takeaways

Keep policy checks explicit and testable.

## Repro notes

Dataset and code were partially available.

## How I'd extend it

Add adversarial drift tests and multilingual cases.
