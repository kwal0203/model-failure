			This site focuses on defensive security outcomes. I do not publish weaponized exploit chains or
			step-by-step offensive deployment instructions.
		</p>
		<p>
			When vulnerabilities involve live systems or third-party products, I coordinate disclosure with
			relevant maintainers first and prioritize mitigation guidance in public writeups.
